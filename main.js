const mineflayerSetup = require('./mineflayerSetup'); // This will execute the code in mineflayerSetup.js

// Since the mineflayer bot setup and event handling is done in mineflayerSetup.js,
// and the httpRequestHandler and payloadBuilder functionalities are imported and used there,
// the main.js file's responsibility is primarily to initiate the process.

console.log('Starting Mineflayer AI ChatBot...');

// Additional code or logic to start, manage, or stop the bot could be added here.
// For example, handling process signals for graceful shutdown, or implementing a command line interface (CLI)
// for controlling the bot could be potential extensions.

// For now, the bot is started and managed through the mineflayerSetup.js file,
// and this main.js acts as the entry point to the application.
