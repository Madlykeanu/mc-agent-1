- ~~add a way for the ai to update descriptions of tools/command if it comes across new information about the command~~
- add feedback for the ai when it tries to use a tool/commands that dosnt exist in its tool library yet
- maybe the ai can test if the command actually works before saving it?
- maybe instead of creating the response before the command executes(in the message field) when it uses one it can execute the command then come up with a response after so if theres an error or something it can tell you about it or try a different way
